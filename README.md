# üåæ Rice Type Classification Using Machine Learning

## üìå Brief Description

This project aims to classify different types of rice grains using machine learning algorithms and deploys the solution via a **Streamlit web application**. By analyzing physical attributes of rice grains‚Äîsuch as area, perimeter, axis lengths, and eccentricity‚Äîthe model classifies grains into one of three categories: **Cammeo**, **Jasmine**

Several ML algorithms were evaluated, including **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Decision Tree**, with **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieving the highest classification accuracy (~96%). The best-performing model is integrated into a **Streamlit app**, where users can input feature values and receive real-time rice type predictions. A test run in the app correctly identified the rice type, validating the pipeline.

## üß† Problem Statement

Manual classification of rice grains is inefficient, prone to human error, and unsuitable for large-scale use. This project proposes an automated system using machine learning to classify rice grains based on measurable physical features, improving accuracy and speed.

## üî¨ Literature Review

- Previous research shows SVM and KNN work well with small but high-quality feature datasets.
- CNNs work well with image data but require extensive data and resources.
- Feature-based models combined with simple classifiers offer a practical solution with good accuracy and low computational needs.

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

1. Collect and preprocess morphological rice grain data.
2. Analyze feature distributions and correlations.
3. Train and evaluate machine learning classifiers.
4. Deploy the best model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
